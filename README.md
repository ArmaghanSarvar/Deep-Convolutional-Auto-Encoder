# Deep-Convolutional-AutoEncoder
* Architecture and Dataset: Encoder-decoder convolutional layers to map the images of ***CelebA*** dataset to themselves

* Annotation Extraction: Storing the annotations attributed to each image

* Training set data augmentation by randomly flipping the images

* Visualizing the latent space for face images by using the ***T-SNE*** algorithm to reduce the embedding layer dimension and comparing the resulting plots with the CIFAR-10 dataset and randomly generated data
